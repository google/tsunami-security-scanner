# Tsunami

Tsunami is a general purpose network security scanner with an extensible plugin
system for detecting high severity vulnerabilities with high confidence.

To learn more about Tsunami, visit our
[documentations](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner/blob/master/docs/index.md).

Tsunami relies heavily on its plugin system to provide basic scanning
capabilities. All publicly available Tsunami plugins are hosted in a separate
[google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins)
repository.

## Current Status

*   Currently Tsunami is in 'pre-alpha' release for developer preview.
*   Tsunami project is currently under active development. Do expect major API
    changes in the future.

## Quick Start

To quickly get started with Tsunami scans,

### Traditional install
 1.  install the following required dependencies:

     ```
     nmap >= 7.80
     ncrack >= 0.7
     ```

 1.  start a vulnerable application that can be identified by Tsunami, e.g. an
      unauthenticated Jupyter Notebook server. The easiest way is to use a docker
      image:
     ```shell
     docker run --name unauthenticated-jupyter-notebook -p 8888:8888 -d jupyter/base-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''
     ```

 1.  execute the following command:

     ```
     bash -c "$(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner/master/quick_start.sh)"
     ```

 The `quick_start.sh` script performs the following tasks:

 1.  Clone the
     [google/tsunami-security-scanner](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner)
     and
     [google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins)
     repos into `$HOME/tsunami/repos` directory.
 1.  Compile all
     [Google Tsunami plugins](https://github.com/google/tsunami-security-scanner-plugins/tree/master/google)
     and move all plugin `jar` files into `$HOME/tsunami/plugins` directory.
 1.  Compile the Tsunami scanner Fat Jar file and move it into `$HOME/tsunami`
     directory.
 1.  Move the `tsunami.yaml` example config into `$HOME/tsunami` directory.
 1.  Print example Tsunami command for scanning `127.0.0.1` using the previously
     generated artifacts.

### Docker install
1.  start a vulnerable application that can be identified by Tsunami, e.g. an
    unauthenticated Jupyter Notebook server. The easiest way is to use a docker
    image:

    ```shell
    docker run --name unauthenticated-jupyter-notebook -p 8888:8888 -d jupyter/base-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''
    ```

1.  build the docker image for Tsunami:

    ```
    docker build -t tsunami .
    ```

1. run the Tsunami image. The logs can be saved to the host machine by mounting a volume:

    ```
    docker run  --network="host" -v "$(pwd)/logs":/usr/tsunami/logs tsunami
    ```
